# FEZ-Lockscreen

![Cover](https://i.imgur.com/YS8NUsH.png)

This is a lockscreen I wrote a long time ago.
It was designed to run on an iPhone 4S.

HTML file loads fine in an explorer, major graphical bugs showing that it didn't pass the test of time.
The code is quite old and dirty, maybe at some point I will go through the pain of fixing it.
