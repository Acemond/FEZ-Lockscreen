# FEZ-Lockscreen

This is a lockscreen I wrote a long time ago.
It was designed to run on a jailbroken iPhone 4S.

HTML file loads fine in an explorer, major graphical bugs showing that this didn't pass the test of time.
I don't dare to look at the code for now, maybe at some point I will go through the pain of fixing it.
